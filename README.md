## The Stories of Science Project
This is the source code for our website, which is hosted on Streamlit. You can access the site through this link: https://storiesofscience.streamlit.app/

This website aims to gather and display the stories of STEM researchers across the country who have been affected by federal funding cuts which began in January 2025. This is a continually evolving project which relies on researchers sharing their stories with us. We hope the website can be a source of information on this important current event, a place to find community int eh shared experiences of STEM researchers across the country, and a digital archive of these stories. 

If you would like to share your story, you can do so here: https://storiesofscience.streamlit.app/map#share-your-story
